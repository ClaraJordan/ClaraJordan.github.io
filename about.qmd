**About this site:**

I am currently taking a class at Colorado State University in Quantitative Reasoning for my undergraduate degree, ESS 330! This website will serve as a repository for my background and projects for all of the data science world to see.

**About me:**

My name is Clara Jordan. Some fun facts about me are that I have lived on three continents and visited over two dozen countries, my favorite of which was Zambia (where I lived in Lusaka from 2017-2021). I love mediterannean food and rock climbing. And I'm learning to code!
