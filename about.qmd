## **About this site**

I am currently taking a class at Colorado State University in Quantitative Reasoning for my undergraduate degree (ESS 330). This website will serve as a repository for my background and projects for all of the data science world to see.

## **About me**

My name is Clara Jordan. I am currently an undergraduate student at Colorado State University in my senior year of a bachelor's degree in Ecosystem Science and Sustainability. In my career I aim to help mitigate climate change through the lenses of sustainable development and carbon management as a sustainability specialist. Some fun facts about me are that I have lived on three continents and visited over two dozen countries, my favorite of which was Zambia (where I lived in Lusaka from 2017-2021). I love Mediterranean food and rock climbing. And I'm learning to code!
