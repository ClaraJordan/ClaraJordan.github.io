## GIS Habitat Suitability Analysis

Visit this [link](https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/oauth2/authorize?client_id=arcgisstorymaps&response_type=token&expiration=20160&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2Fstorymaps.arcgis.com%2Foauth-callback%3FreturnURL%3D%252Fstories%252F934be7c488d64c40a81005f906f169f7&hideCancel=true&showSignupOption=true&force_login=true) to see a project that I created about determining suitable wolverine habitat in Colorado through a GIS suitability analysis in ArcGIS WebMap.

Some things that I learned in this project are:

-   Curating sources of relevant data across topography, snowpack patterns, and transportation maps;

-   Developing an ArcGIS model to perform suitability analysis and analyze results;

-   Communicating results through an Arc StoryMap medium.

## CSU ESS 330 Lab 2: COVID-19 Data Analysis

Visit think [link](https://github.com/ClaraJordan/Lab2_MinnesotaTreeGrowth.git) to see a lab I worked on in my CSU ESS 330 course to work with Minnesota tree growth data.

Some things I learned in this project are:

-   Working with a data set through identifying data structure through columns, rows, and creating / renaming new columns;

-   Summarizing data through grouping and using functions such as case when and if else;

-   Analyzing grouped data and applying a piping structure through dplyr verbs.

## CSU ESS 330 Lab 3: COVID-19 Data Analysis

Visit this [link](https://github.com/ClaraJordan/CSUESS_Lab3_Covid.git) to see a project I worked on in my CSU ESS 330 course to analyze a COVID-19 data set curated by the New York Times.

Some things that I learned in this project are:

-   Normalizing data to optimize its formatting for analysis;

-   Apply several calculations to produce rolling thresholds, death tolls, and case counts across temporal scales;

-   Visualize COVID-19 case and death trends over spatial and temporal scales to effectively communicate trends in the data set.

## CSU ESS 330 Lab 4: Statistical Analysis on Long Term Ecological Research Data

Visit this [link](https://github.com/ClaraJordan/Lab4_LTER.git) to see another lab I worked on in my CSU ESS 330 course to conduct univariate and bivariate statistical analysis to analyze Andrews Forest Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) facility in Oregon in the Cascade Mountains.

Some things that I learned in this project are:

-   Application of several statistical tests including t-tests, covariance analysis, ANOVA, and Post-hoc Tukey's HSD test;

-   The steps to developing a regression model including testing for correlation between variables to avoid multicolinearity and testing statistical test assumptions;

-   Visualizing statistical results through plotting linear regression models and assessing residual normality through QQ plots.
