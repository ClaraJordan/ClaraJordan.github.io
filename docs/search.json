In my career I aim to help mitigate climate change through the lenses of sustainable development and carbon management as a sustainability specialist. Some fun facts about me are that I have lived on three continents and visited over two dozen countries, my favorite of which was Zambia (where I lived in Lusaka from 2017-2021). I love Mediterranean food and rock climbing. And I’m learning to code!"
