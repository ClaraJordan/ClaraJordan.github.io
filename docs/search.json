This website will serve as a repository for my background and projects for all of the data science world to see.\nAbout me:\nMy name is Clara Jordan. Some fun facts about me are that I have lived on three continents and visited over two dozen countries, my favorite of which was Zambia (where I lived in Lusaka from 2017-2021). I love mediterannean food and rock climbing. And I’m learning to code!"
